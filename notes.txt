How to increase FPS on OSX:
1. Run pygame program
2. Right click on snake icon in dock

5. Right click the python application and click “Get Info”
6. Check the box “Open in Low Resolution”

How to create sprites:
1. Screen record (Shift+Cmd+5) sprite from here : https://gfl.zzzzz.kr/doll.php?id=20&lang=en in a 170x170 pixel box
2. Trim outputted .mov file to exactly 1 second (sprites loop every 60 frames and are 60 FPS)
3. Put trimmed .mov file in empty folder and run following command: ffmpeg -i movie.mov -y -f image2 -c:v png %02d.png
4. This process returns 170x171 png files so need to crop bottom row from each file (write a script for this)
5. Use https://onlinepngtools.com/create-transparent-png to make each .png transparent (3% match for color tones seems to work well, maybe try 2%. Use the preview transparency mask to view what becomes transparent).
